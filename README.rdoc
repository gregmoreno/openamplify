= OpenAmplify

The OpenAmplify API reads text you supply and returns linguistic data 
explaining and classifying the content. What you do with that analysis is, 
in the fine tradition of APIs and mashups, up to you. Some possibilities 
might include pairing ads with articles, creating rich tag-clouds, or 
monitoring the tone of forum threads.
